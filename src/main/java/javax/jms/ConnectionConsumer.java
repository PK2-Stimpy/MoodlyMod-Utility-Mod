/** For application servers, {@code Connection} objects provide a special

  * a {@code ConnectionConsumer} must be given a 
  * {@code ServerSessionPool} to use for 
  * processing its messages.
  *
  * <P>Normally, when traffic is light, a {@code ConnectionConsumer} gets a
  * {@code ServerSession} from its pool, loads it with a single message, and
  * starts it. As traffic picks up, messages can back up. If this happens, 
  * a {@code ConnectionConsumer} can load each {@code ServerSession}
  * with more than one 
  * message. This reduces the thread context switches and minimizes resource 
  * use at the expense of some serialization of message processing.
