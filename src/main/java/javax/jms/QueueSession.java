/** A {@code QueueSession} object provides methods for creating 
  * {@code QueueReceiver}, {@code QueueSender}, 
  * {@code QueueBrowser}, and {@code TemporaryQueue} objects.
  *
  * <P>If there are messages that have been received but not acknowledged 
  * when a {@code QueueSession} terminates, these messages will be retained 
  * and redelivered when a consumer next accesses the queue.
  *
  *<P>A {@code QueueSession} is used for creating Point-to-Point specific
  * objects. In general, use the {@code Session} object. 
  * The {@code QueueSession} is used to support
  * existing code. Using the {@code Session} object simplifies the 
  * programming model, and allows transactions to be used across the two 
  * messaging domains.
  * 
  * <P>A {@code QueueSession} cannot be used to create objects specific to the 
  * publish/subscribe domain. The following methods inherit from 
  * {@code Session}, but must throw an
  * {@code IllegalStateException} 
  * if they are used from {@code QueueSession}:
  *<UL>
  *   <LI>{@code createDurableSubscriber}
  *   <LI>{@code createDurableConsumer}
  *   <LI>{@code createSharedConsumer}
  *   <LI>{@code createSharedDurableConsumer}
