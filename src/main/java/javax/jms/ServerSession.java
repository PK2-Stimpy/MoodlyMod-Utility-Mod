/** A {@code ServerSession} object is an application server object that 
  * is used by a server to associate a thread with a JMS session (optional).
  *
  * <P>A {@code ServerSession} implements two methods:
  *
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>{@code getSession} - returns the {@code ServerSession}'s 
  *       JMS session.
  *   <LI>{@code start} - starts the execution of the 
  *       {@code ServerSession} 
  *       thread and results in the execution of the JMS session's 
  *       {@code run} method.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <P>A {@code ConnectionConsumer} implemented by a JMS provider uses a 
  * {@code ServerSession} to process one or more messages that have 
  * arrived. It does this by getting a {@code ServerSession} from the 
  * {@code ConnectionConsumer}'s {@code ServerSessionPool}; getting 
  * the {@code ServerSession}'s JMS session; loading it with the messages; 
  * and then starting the {@code ServerSession}.
  *
  * <P>In most cases the {@code ServerSession} will register some object 
  * it provides as the {@code ServerSession}'s thread run object. The 
  * {@code ServerSession}'s {@code start} method will call the 
  * thread's {@code start} method, which will start the new thread, and 
  * from it, call the {@code run} method of the 
  * {@code ServerSession}'s run object. This object will do some 
  * housekeeping and then call the {@code Session}'s {@code run} 
  * method. When {@code run} returns, the {@code ServerSession}'s run 
  * object can return the {@code ServerSession} to the 
  * {@code ServerSessionPool}, and the cycle starts again.
  *
  * <P>Note that the JMS API does not architect how the 
  * {@code ConnectionConsumer} loads the {@code Session} with 
  * messages. Since both the {@code ConnectionConsumer} and 
  * {@code Session} are implemented by the same JMS provider, they can 
  * accomplish the load using a private mechanism.
  *
  * @see         javax.jms.ServerSessionPool
  * @see         javax.jms.ConnectionConsumer
  * 
  * @version JMS 2.0
  * @since JMS 1.0
