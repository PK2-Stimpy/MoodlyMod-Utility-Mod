/** A {@code BytesMessage} object is used to send a message containing a 
  * stream of uninterpreted bytes. It inherits from the {@code Message} 
  * interface and adds a bytes
  * message body. The receiver of the message supplies the interpretation
  * of the bytes.
  *
  * <P>The {@code BytesMessage} methods are based largely on those found in
  * {@code java.io.DataInputStream} and
  * {@code java.io.DataOutputStream}.
  *
  * <P>This message type is for client encoding of existing message formats. 
  * If possible, one of the other self-defining message types should be used 
  * instead.
  *
  * <P>Although the JMS API allows the use of message properties with byte 
  * messages, they are typically not used, since the inclusion of properties 
  * may affect the format.
  *
  * <P>The primitive types can be written explicitly using methods
  * for each type. They may also be written generically as objects.
  * For instance, a call to {@code BytesMessage.writeInt(6)} is
  * equivalent to {@code BytesMessage.writeObject(new Integer(6))}.
  * Both forms are provided, because the explicit form is convenient for
  * static programming, and the object form is needed when types are not known
  * at compile time.
  *
  * <P>When the message is first created, and when {@code clearBody}
  * is called, the body of the message is in write-only mode. After the 
  * first call to {@code reset} has been made, the message body is in 
  * read-only mode. 
  * When a {@code BytesMessage} is sent asynchronously, the provider 
  * must call {@code reset} on the {@code BytesMessage} passed to 
  * the {@code CompletionListener}. This means that the 
  * {@code CompletionListener} can read the message body without 
  * needing to call {@code reset}. 
  * After a message has been sent, the client that sent it can retain and 
  * modify it without affecting the message that has been sent. The same message
  * object can be sent multiple times.
  * When a message has been received, the provider has called 
  * {@code reset} so that the message body is in read-only mode for the client.
  *
  * <P>If {@code clearBody} is called on a message in read-only mode, 
  * the message body is cleared and the message is in write-only mode.
  *
  * <P>If a client attempts to read a message in write-only mode, a 
  * {@code MessageNotReadableException} is thrown.
  *
  * <P>If a client attempts to write a message in read-only mode, a 
  * {@code MessageNotWriteableException} is thrown.
