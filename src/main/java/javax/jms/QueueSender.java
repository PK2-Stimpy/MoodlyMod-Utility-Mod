/** A client uses a {@code QueueSender} object to send messages to a queue.
  * 
  * <P>Normally, the {@code Queue} is specified when a 
  * {@code QueueSender} is created.  In this case, an attempt to use
  * the {@code send} methods for an unidentified 
  * {@code QueueSender} will throw a 
  * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
  * 
  * <P>If the {@code QueueSender} is created with an unidentified 
  * {@code Queue}, an attempt to use the {@code send} methods that 
  * assume that the {@code Queue} has been identified will throw a
  * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
  *
  * <P>During the execution of its {@code send} method, a message 
  * must not be changed by other threads within the client. 
  * If the message is modified, the result of the {@code send} is 
  * undefined.
  * 
  * <P>After sending a message, a client may retain and modify it
  * without affecting the message that has been sent. The same message
  * object may be sent multiple times.
  * 
  * <P>The following message headers are set as part of sending a 
  * message: {@code JMSDestination}, {@code JMSDeliveryMode}, 
  * {@code JMSExpiration}, {@code JMSPriority}, 
  * {@code JMSMessageID} and {@code JMSTimeStamp}.
  * When the message is sent, the values of these headers are ignored. 
  * After the completion of the {@code send}, the headers hold the values 
  * specified by the method sending the message. It is possible for the 
  * {@code send} method not to set {@code JMSMessageID} and 
  * {@code JMSTimeStamp} if the 
  * setting of these headers is explicitly disabled by the 
  * {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageID} or
  * {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageTimestamp} method.
  *
  * <P>Creating a {@code MessageProducer} provides the same features as
  * creating a {@code QueueSender}. A {@code MessageProducer} object is 
  * recommended when creating new code. The  {@code QueueSender} is
  * provided to support existing code.
  *
