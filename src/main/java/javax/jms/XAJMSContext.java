/**
 * The {@code XAJMSContext} interface extends the capability of
 * {@code JMSContext} by adding access to a JMS provider's support for the Java
 * Transaction API (JTA) (optional). This support takes the form of a
 * {@code javax.transaction.xa.XAResource} object. The functionality of this
 * object closely resembles that defined by the standard X/Open XA Resource
 * interface.
 * 
 * <P>
 * An application server controls the transactional assignment of an
 * {@code XASession} by obtaining its {@code XAResource}. It uses the
 * {@code XAResource} to assign the session to a transaction, prepare and commit
 * work on the transaction, and so on.
 * 
 * <P>
 * An {@code XAResource} provides some fairly sophisticated facilities for
 * interleaving work on multiple transactions, recovering a list of transactions
 * in progress, and so on. A JTA aware JMS provider must fully implement this
 * functionality. This could be done by using the services of a database that
 * supports XA, or a JMS provider may choose to implement this functionality
 * from scratch.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A client of the application server is given what it thinks is an ordinary
 * {@code JMSContext}. Behind the scenes, the application server controls the
 * transaction management of the underlying {@code XAJMSContext}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The {@code XAJMSContext} interface is optional. JMS providers are not
 * required to support this interface. This interface is for use by JMS
 * providers to support transactional environments. Client programs are strongly
 * encouraged to use the transactional support available in their environment,
 * rather than use these XA interfaces directly.
