  	 * This method creates the durable subscription without a message selector 
  	 * and with a {@code noLocal} value of {@code false}. 
	 * <p>
	 * A durable subscription is used by an application which needs to receive
	 * all the messages published on a topic, including the ones published when
	 * there is no active consumer associated with it. The JMS provider retains
	 * a record of this durable subscription and ensures that all messages from
	 * the topic's publishers are retained until they are delivered to, and
	 * acknowledged by, a consumer on this durable subscription or until they
	 * have expired.
	 * <p>
	 * A durable subscription will continue to accumulate messages until it is
	 * deleted using the {@code unsubscribe} method.
	 * <p>
	 * This method may only be used with non-shared durable subscriptions. Any
	 * durable subscription created using this method will be non-shared. This
	 * means that only one active (i.e. not closed) consumer on the subscription
	 * may exist at a time. The term "consumer" here means a
	 * {@code TopicSubscriber}, {@code  MessageConsumer} or {@code JMSConsumer}
	 * object in any client.
	 * <p>
	 * An unshared durable subscription is identified by a name specified by
	 * the client and by the client identifier, which must be set. An
	 * application which subsequently wishes to create a consumer on that
	 * non-shared durable subscription must use the same client identifier.

	 * part of a pending transaction or are not yet acknowledged in the session,

	 * and client identifier, and there is a consumer already active (i.e. not

	 * that subscription are still part of a pending transaction or are not yet
