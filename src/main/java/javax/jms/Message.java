/** The {@code Message} interface is the root interface of all JMS 
  * messages. It defines the message header and the {@code acknowledge} 
  * method used for all messages.
  *
  * <P>Most message-oriented middleware (MOM) products treat messages as 
  * lightweight entities that consist
  * of a header and a body. The header contains fields used for message
  * routing and identification; the body contains the application data
  * being sent.
  *
  * <P>Within this general form, the definition of a message varies
  * significantly across products. It would be quite difficult for the JMS API
  * to support all of these message models.
  *
  * <P>With this in mind, the JMS message model has the following goals:
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>Provide a single, unified message API
  *   <LI>Provide an API suitable for creating messages that match the
  *       format used by provider-native messaging applications
  *   <LI>Support the development of heterogeneous applications that span
  *       operating systems, machine architectures, and computer languages
  *   <LI>Support messages containing objects in the Java programming language
  *       ("Java objects")
  *   <LI>Support messages containing Extensible Markup Language (XML) pages
  * </UL>
  *
  * <P>JMS messages are composed of the following parts:
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>Header - All messages support the same set of header fields. 
  *       Header fields contain values used by both clients and providers to 
  *       identify and route messages.
  *   <LI>Properties - Each message contains a built-in facility for supporting
  *       application-defined property values. Properties provide an efficient 
  *       mechanism for supporting application-defined message filtering.
  *   <LI>Body - The JMS API defines several types of message body, which cover
  *       the majority of messaging styles currently in use.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <H4>Message Bodies</H4>
  *
  * <P>The JMS API defines five types of message body:
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>Stream - A {@code StreamMessage} object's message body contains 
  *       a stream of primitive values in the Java programming 
  *       language ("Java primitives"). It is filled and read sequentially.
  *   <LI>Map - A {@code MapMessage} object's message body contains a set 
  *       of name-value pairs, where names are {@code String} 
  *       objects, and values are Java primitives. The entries can be accessed 
  *       sequentially or randomly by name. The order of the entries is 
  *       undefined.
  *   <LI>Text - A {@code TextMessage} object's message body contains a 
  *       {@code java.lang.String} object. This message type can be used
  *       to transport plain-text messages, and XML messages.
  *   <LI>Object - An {@code ObjectMessage} object's message body contains 
  *       a {@code Serializable} Java object.
  *   <LI>Bytes - A {@code BytesMessage} object's message body contains a 
  *       stream of uninterpreted bytes. This message type is for 
  *       literally encoding a body to match an existing message format. In 
  *       many cases, it is possible to use one of the other body types, 
  *       which are easier to use. Although the JMS API allows the use of  
  *       message properties with byte messages, they are typically not used,
  *       since the inclusion of properties may affect the format.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <H4>Message Headers</H4>
  *
  * <P>The {@code JMSCorrelationID} header field is used for linking one 
  * message with
  * another. It typically links a reply message with its requesting message.
  *
  * <P>{@code JMSCorrelationID} can hold a provider-specific message ID,
  * an application-specific {@code String} object, or a provider-native 
  * {@code byte[]} value.
  *
  * <H4>Message Properties</H4>
  *
  * <P>A {@code Message} object contains a built-in facility for supporting
  * application-defined property values. In effect, this provides a mechanism 
  * for adding application-specific header fields to a message.
  *
  * <P>Properties allow an application, via message selectors, to have a JMS 
  * provider select, or filter, messages on its behalf using 
  * application-specific criteria.
  *
  * <P>Property names must obey the rules for a message selector identifier. 
  * Property names must not be null, and must not be empty strings. If a property
  * name is set and it is either null or an empty string, an 
  * {@code IllegalArgumentException} must be thrown.
  *
  * <P>Property values can be {@code boolean}, {@code byte}, 
  * {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float},
  * {@code double}, and {@code String}.
  *
  * <P>Property values are set prior to sending a message. When a client 
  * receives a message, its properties are in read-only mode. If a 
  * client attempts to set properties at this point, a 
  * {@code MessageNotWriteableException} is thrown. If 
  * {@code clearProperties} is called, the properties can now be both
  * read from and written to. Note that header fields are distinct from 
  * properties. Header fields are never in read-only mode. 
  *
  * <P>A property value may duplicate a value in a message's body, or it may 
  * not. Although JMS does not define a policy for what should or should not 
  * be made a property, application developers should note that JMS providers 
  * will likely handle data in a message's body more efficiently than data in 
  * a message's properties. For best performance, applications should use
  * message properties only when they need to customize a message's header. 
  * The primary reason for doing this is to support customized message 
  * selection.
  *
  * <P>Message properties support the following conversion table. The marked 
  * cases must be supported. The unmarked cases must throw a 
  * {@code JMSException}. The {@code String}-to-primitive conversions 
  * may throw a runtime exception if the
  * primitive's {@code valueOf} method does not accept the 
  * {@code String} as a valid representation of the primitive.
  *
  * <P>A value written as the row type can be read as the column type.
  *
  * <PRE>
  * |        | boolean byte short int long float double String 
  * |----------------------------------------------------------
  * |boolean |    X                                       X
  * |byte    |          X     X    X   X                  X 
  * |short   |                X    X   X                  X

  * |----------------------------------------------------------
  * </PRE>
  *
  * <P>In addition to the type-specific set/get methods for properties, JMS 
  * provides the {@code setObjectProperty} and 
  * {@code getObjectProperty} methods. These support the same set of 
  * property types using the objectified primitive values. Their purpose is 
  * to allow the decision of property type to made at execution time rather 
  * than at compile time. They support the same property value conversions.
  *
  * <P>The {@code setObjectProperty} method accepts values of class 
  * {@code Boolean}, {@code Byte}, {@code Short}, 
  * {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Float}, 
  * {@code Double}, and {@code String}. An attempt 
  * to use any other class must throw a {@code JMSException}.
  *
  * <P>The {@code getObjectProperty} method only returns values of class 
  * {@code Boolean}, {@code Byte}, {@code Short}, 
  * {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Float}, 
  * {@code Double}, and {@code String}.
  *
  * <P>The order of property values is not defined. To iterate through a 
  * message's property values, use {@code getPropertyNames} to retrieve 
  * a property name enumeration and then use the various property get methods 
  * to retrieve their values.
  *
  * <P>A message's properties are deleted by the {@code clearProperties}
  * method. This leaves the message with an empty set of properties.
  *
  * <P>Getting a property value for a name which has not been set returns a 
  * null value. Only the {@code getStringProperty} and 
  * {@code getObjectProperty} methods can return a null value. 
  * Attempting to read a null value as a primitive type must be treated as 
  * calling the primitive's corresponding {@code valueOf(String)} 
  * conversion method with a null value.
  *
  * <P>The JMS API reserves the {@code JMSX} property name prefix for JMS 
  * defined properties.
  * The full set of these properties is defined in the Java Message Service
  * specification. The specification also defines whether support for each
  * property is mandatory or optional.  
  * New JMS defined properties may be added in later versions 
  * of the JMS API.  The 
  * {@code String[] ConnectionMetaData.getJMSXPropertyNames} method 
  * returns the names of the JMSX properties supported by a connection.
  *
  * <P>JMSX properties may be referenced in message selectors whether or not
  * they are supported by a connection. If they are not present in a
  * message, they are treated like any other absent property.
  * The effect of setting a message selector on a property 
  * which is set by the provider on receive is undefined.
  *
  * <P>JMSX properties defined in the specification as "set by provider on 
  * send" are available to both the producer and the consumers of the message. 
  * JMSX properties defined in the specification as "set by provider on 
  * receive" are available only to the consumers.
  *
  * <P>{@code JMSXGroupID} and {@code JMSXGroupSeq} are standard 
  * properties that clients 
  * should use if they want to group messages. All providers must support them.
  * Unless specifically noted, the values and semantics of the JMSX properties 
  * are undefined.
  *
  * <P>The JMS API reserves the <CODE>JMS_<I>vendor_name</I></CODE> property 
  * name prefix for provider-specific properties. Each provider defines its own 
  * value for <CODE><I>vendor_name</I></CODE>. This is the mechanism a JMS 
  * provider uses to make its special per-message services available to a JMS 
  * client.
  *
  * <P>The purpose of provider-specific properties is to provide special 
  * features needed to integrate JMS clients with provider-native clients in a 
  * single JMS application. They should not be used for messaging between JMS 
  * clients.
  *
  * <H4>Provider Implementations of JMS Message Interfaces</H4>
  *
  * <P>The JMS API provides a set of message interfaces that define the JMS 
  * message 
  * model. It does not provide implementations of these interfaces.
  *
  * <P>Each JMS provider supplies a set of message factories with its 
  * {@code Session} object for creating instances of messages. This allows 
  * a provider to use message implementations tailored to its specific needs.
  *
  * <P>A provider must be prepared to accept message implementations that are 
  * not its own. They may not be handled as efficiently as its own 
  * implementation; however, they must be handled.
  *
  * <P>Note the following exception case when a provider is handling a foreign 
  * message implementation. If the foreign message implementation contains a 
  * {@code JMSReplyTo} header field that is set to a foreign destination 
  * implementation, the provider is not required to handle or preserve the 
  * value of this header field. 
  *
  * <H4>Message Selectors</H4>
  *
  * <P>A JMS message selector allows a client to specify, by
  * header field references and property references, the
  * messages it is interested in. Only messages whose header 
  * and property values
  * match the 
  * selector are delivered. What it means for a message not to be delivered
  * depends on the {@code MessageConsumer} being used (see 
  * {@link javax.jms.QueueReceiver QueueReceiver} and 
  * {@link javax.jms.TopicSubscriber TopicSubscriber}).
  *
  * <P>Message selectors cannot reference message body values.
  *
  * <P>A message selector matches a message if the selector evaluates to 
  * true when the message's header field values and property values are 
  * substituted for their corresponding identifiers in the selector.
  *
  * <P>A message selector is a {@code String} whose syntax is based on a 
  * subset of 
  * the SQL92 conditional expression syntax. If the value of a message selector 
  * is an empty string, the value is treated as a null and indicates that there 
  * is no message selector for the message consumer. 
  *
  * <P>The order of evaluation of a message selector is from left to right 
  * within precedence level. Parentheses can be used to change this order.
  *
  * <P>Predefined selector literals and operator names are shown here in 
  * uppercase; however, they are case insensitive.
  *
  * <P>A selector can contain:
  *
  * <UL>
  *   <LI>Literals:
  *   <UL>
  *     <LI>A string literal is enclosed in single quotes, with a single quote 
  *         represented by doubled single quote; for example, 
  *         {@code 'literal'} and {@code 'literal''s'}. Like 
  *         string literals in the Java programming language, these use the 
  *         Unicode character encoding.
  *     <LI>An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal 
  *         point, such as {@code 57}, {@code -957}, and  
  *         {@code +62}; numbers in the range of {@code long} are 
  *         supported. Exact numeric literals use the integer literal 
  *         syntax of the Java programming language.
  *     <LI>An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific 
  *         notation, such as {@code 7E3} and {@code -57.9E2}, or a 
  *         numeric value with a decimal, such as {@code 7.}, 
  *         {@code -95.7}, and {@code +6.2}; numbers in the range of 
  *         {@code double} are supported. Approximate literals use the 
  *         floating-point literal syntax of the Java programming language.
  *     <LI>The boolean literals {@code TRUE} and {@code FALSE}.
  *   </UL>
  *   <LI>Identifiers:
  *   <UL>
  *     <LI>An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of letters 
  *         and digits, the first of which must be a letter. A letter is any 
  *         character for which the method {@code Character.isJavaLetter}
  *         returns true. This includes {@code '_'} and {@code '$'}.
  *         A letter or digit is any character for which the method 
  *         {@code Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit} returns true.
  *     <LI>Identifiers cannot be the names {@code NULL}, 
  *         {@code TRUE}, and {@code FALSE}.
  *     <LI>Identifiers cannot be {@code NOT}, {@code AND}, 
  *         {@code OR}, {@code BETWEEN}, {@code LIKE}, 
  *         {@code IN}, {@code IS}, or {@code ESCAPE}.
  *     <LI>Identifiers are either header field references or property 
  *         references.  The type of a property value in a message selector 
  *         corresponds to the type used to set the property. If a property 
  *         that does not exist in a message is referenced, its value is 
  *         {@code NULL}.
  *     <LI>The conversions that apply to the get methods for properties do not
  *         apply when a property is used in a message selector expression.
  *         For example, suppose you set a property as a string value, as in the
  *         following:
  *         <PRE>myMessage.setStringProperty("NumberOfOrders", "2");</PRE>
  *         The following expression in a message selector would evaluate to 
  *         false, because a string cannot be used in an arithmetic expression:
  *         <PRE>"NumberOfOrders > 1"</PRE>
  *     <LI>Identifiers are case-sensitive.
  *     <LI>Message header field references are restricted to 
  *         {@code JMSDeliveryMode}, {@code JMSPriority}, 
  *         {@code JMSMessageID}, {@code JMSTimestamp}, 
  *         {@code JMSCorrelationID}, and {@code JMSType}. 
  *         {@code JMSMessageID}, {@code JMSCorrelationID}, and 
  *         {@code JMSType} values may be null and if so are treated as a 
  *         {@code NULL} value.
  *     <LI>Any name beginning with {@code 'JMSX'} is a JMS defined  
  *         property name.
  *     <LI>Any name beginning with {@code 'JMS_'} is a provider-specific 
  *         property name.
  *     <LI>Any name that does not begin with {@code 'JMS'} is an 
  *         application-specific property name.
  *   </UL>
  *   <LI>White space is the same as that defined for the Java programming
  *       language: space, horizontal tab, form feed, and line terminator.
  *   <LI>Expressions: 
  *   <UL>
  *     <LI>A selector is a conditional expression; a selector that evaluates 
  *         to {@code true} matches; a selector that evaluates to 
  *         {@code false} or unknown does not match.
  *     <LI>Arithmetic expressions are composed of themselves, arithmetic 
  *         operations, identifiers (whose value is treated as a numeric 
  *         literal), and numeric literals.
  *     <LI>Conditional expressions are composed of themselves, comparison 
  *         operations, and logical operations.
  *   </UL>
  *   <LI>Standard bracketing {@code ()} for ordering expression evaluation
  *      is supported.
  *   <LI>Logical operators in precedence order: {@code NOT}, 
  *       {@code AND}, {@code OR}
  *   <LI>Comparison operators: {@code =}, {@code >}, {@code >=},
  *       {@code <}, {@code <=}, {@code <>} (not equal)
  *   <UL>
  *     <LI>Only like type values can be compared. One exception is that it 
  *         is valid to compare exact numeric values and approximate numeric 
  *         values; the type conversion required is defined by the rules of 
  *         numeric promotion in the Java programming language. If the 
  *         comparison of non-like type values is attempted, the value of the 
  *         operation is false. If either of the type values evaluates to 
  *         {@code NULL}, the value of the expression is unknown.   
  *     <LI>String and boolean comparison is restricted to {@code =} and 
  *         {@code <>}. Two strings are equal 
  *         if and only if they contain the same sequence of characters.
  *   </UL>
  *   <LI>Arithmetic operators in precedence order:
  *   <UL>
  *     <LI>{@code +}, {@code -} (unary)
  *     <LI>{@code *}, {@code /} (multiplication and division)
  *     <LI>{@code +}, {@code -} (addition and subtraction)
  *     <LI>Arithmetic operations must use numeric promotion in the Java 
  *         programming language.

  * <P>JMS providers are required to verify the syntactic correctness of a

  *  syntactically incorrect selector must result in a {@code JMSException}.
  * JMS providers may also optionally provide some semantic checking at the time
  * the selector is presented. Not all semantic checking can be performed at
  * the time a message selector is presented, because property types are not known.
  * 
  * <P>The following message selector selects messages with a message type 
  * of car and color of blue and weight greater than 2500 pounds:
  *
  * <PRE>"JMSType&nbsp;=&nbsp;'car'&nbsp;AND&nbsp;color&nbsp;=&nbsp;'blue'&nbsp;AND&nbsp;weight&nbsp;>&nbsp;2500"</PRE>
  *
  * <H4>Null Values</H4>
  *
  * <P>As noted above, property values may be {@code NULL}. The evaluation 
  * of selector expressions containing {@code NULL} values is defined by 
  * SQL92 {@code NULL} semantics. A brief description of these semantics 
  * is provided here.
  *
  * <P>SQL treats a {@code NULL} value as unknown. Comparison or arithmetic
  * with an unknown value always yields an unknown value.
  *
  * <P>The {@code IS NULL} and {@code IS NOT NULL} operators convert 
  * an unknown value into the respective {@code TRUE} and 
  * {@code FALSE} values.
  *
  * <P>The boolean operators use three-valued logic as defined by the 
  * following tables:

  *
  * <P>When used in a message selector, the {@code JMSDeliveryMode} header 
  *    field is treated as having the values {@code 'PERSISTENT'} and 
  *    {@code 'NON_PERSISTENT'}.
  *
  * <P>Date and time values should use the standard {@code long} 
  *    millisecond value. When a date or time literal is included in a message 
  *    selector, it should be an integer literal for a millisecond value. The 
  *    standard way to produce millisecond values is to use 
  *    {@code java.util.Calendar}.
  *
  * <P>Although SQL supports fixed decimal comparison and arithmetic, JMS 
  *    message selectors do not. This is the reason for restricting exact 
  *    numeric literals to those without a decimal (and the addition of 
  *    numerics with a decimal as an alternate representation for 
  *    approximate numeric values).
