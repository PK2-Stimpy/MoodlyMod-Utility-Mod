/** A {@code StreamMessage} object is used to send a stream of primitive
  * types in the Java programming language. It is filled and read sequentially.
  * It inherits from the {@code Message} interface
  * and adds a stream message body. Its methods are based largely on those
  * found in {@code java.io.DataInputStream} and
  * {@code java.io.DataOutputStream}.
  *
  * <P>The primitive types can be read or written explicitly using methods
  * for each type. They may also be read or written generically as objects.
  * For instance, a call to {@code StreamMessage.writeInt(6)} is
  * equivalent to {@code StreamMessage.writeObject(new Integer(6))}.
  * Both forms are provided, because the explicit form is convenient for
  * static programming, and the object form is needed when types are not known
  * at compile time.
  *
  * <P>When the message is first created, and when {@code clearBody}
  * is called, the body of the message is in write-only mode. After the 
  * first call to {@code reset} has been made, the message body is in 
  * read-only mode. 
  * After a message has been sent, the client that sent it can retain and 
  * modify it without affecting the message that has been sent. The same message
  * object can be sent multiple times.
  * When a message has been received, the provider has called 
  * {@code reset} so that the message body is in read-only mode for the client.
  * 
  * <P>If {@code clearBody} is called on a message in read-only mode, 
  * the message body is cleared and the message body is in write-only mode.
  * 
  * <P>If a client attempts to read a message in write-only mode, a 
  * {@code MessageNotReadableException} is thrown.
  * 
  * <P>If a client attempts to write a message in read-only mode, a 
  * {@code MessageNotWriteableException} is thrown.
  *
  * <P>{@code StreamMessage} objects support the following conversion 
  * table. The marked cases must be supported. The unmarked cases must throw a 
  * {@code JMSException}. The {@code String}-to-primitive conversions 
  * may throw a runtime exception if the primitive's {@code valueOf()} 
  * method does not accept it as a valid {@code String} representation of 
  * the primitive.
  *
  * <P>A value written as the row type can be read as the column type.
