/** The delivery modes supported by the JMS API are {@code PERSISTENT} and

  *
  * <P>A client marks a message as persistent if it feels that the 
  * application will have problems if the message is lost in transit.
  * A client marks a message as non-persistent if an occasional
  * lost message is tolerable. Clients use delivery mode to tell a
  * JMS provider how to balance message transport reliability with throughput.
  *
  * <P>Delivery mode covers only the transport of the message to its 
  * destination. Retention of a message at the destination until
  * its receipt is acknowledged is not guaranteed by a {@code PERSISTENT} 
  * delivery mode. Clients should assume that message retention 
  * policies are set administratively. Message retention policy
  * governs the reliability of message delivery from destination
  * to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage 
  * space is exhausted, some messages may be dropped in accordance with 
  * a site-specific message retention policy.
  *
  * <P>A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once
  * by a JMS provider if the delivery mode of the message is 
  * {@code PERSISTENT} 
  * and if the destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
