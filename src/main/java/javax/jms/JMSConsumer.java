/**
 * A client using the simplified JMS API introduced for JMS 2.0 uses a
 * {@code JMSConsumer} object to receive messages from a queue or topic. A
 * {@code JMSConsumer} object may be created either created by passing a
 * {@code Queue} or {@code Topic} object to one of the {@code createConsumer}
 * methods on a {@code JMSContext}. or by passing a {@code Topic} object to one
 * of the {@code createSharedConsumer} or {@code createDurableConsumer} methods
 * on a {@code JMSContext}.
 * <P>
 * A {@code JMSConsumer} can be created with a message selector. A message
 * selector allows the client to restrict the messages delivered to the
 * {@code JMSConsumer} to those that match the selector.
 * <p>
 * A client may either synchronously receive a {@code JMSConsumer}'s messages or
 * have the {@code JMSConsumer} asynchronously deliver them as they arrive.
 * <p>
 * For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a
 * {@code JMSConsumer} using one of its {@code receive} methods. There are
 * several variations of {@code receive} that allow a client to poll or wait for
 * the next message.
 * <p>
 * For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a {@code MessageListener}
 * object with a {@code JMSConsumer}. As messages arrive at the
 * {@code JMSConsumer}, it delivers them by calling the {@code MessageListener}
 * 's {@code onMessage} method.
 * <p>
 * It is a client programming error for a {@code MessageListener} to throw an
 * exception.
