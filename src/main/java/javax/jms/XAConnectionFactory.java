/** The {@code XAConnectionFactory} interface is a base interface for the
  * {@code XAQueueConnectionFactory} and 
  * {@code XATopicConnectionFactory} interfaces.
  *
  * <P>Some application servers provide support for grouping JTA capable 
  * resource use into a distributed transaction (optional). To include JMS API transactions 
  * in a JTA transaction, an application server requires a JTA aware JMS
  * provider. A JMS provider exposes its JTA support using an
  * {@code XAConnectionFactory} object, which an application server uses 
  * to create {@code XAConnection} objects.
  *
  * <P>{@code XAConnectionFactory} objects are JMS administered objects, 
  * just like {@code ConnectionFactory} objects. It is expected that 
  * application servers will find them using the Java Naming and Directory
  * Interface (JNDI) API.
  *
  *<P>The {@code XAConnectionFactory} interface is optional. JMS providers 
  * are not required to support this interface. This interface is for 
  * use by JMS providers to support transactional environments. 
  * Client programs are strongly encouraged to use the transactional support
  * available in their environment, rather than use these XA
  * interfaces directly.
