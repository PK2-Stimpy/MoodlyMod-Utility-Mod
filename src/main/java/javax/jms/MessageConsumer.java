/** A client uses a {@code MessageConsumer} object to receive messages 
 * from a destination.  A {@code MessageConsumer} object is created by 
 * passing a {@code Destination} object to a message-consumer creation
 * method supplied by a session.
 *
 * <P>{@code MessageConsumer} is the parent interface for all message 
 * consumers.
 *
 * <P>A {@code MessageConsumer} can be created with a message selector. A message
 * selector allows 
 * the client to restrict the messages delivered to the message consumer to 
 * those that match the selector.
 * <p>
 * A client may either synchronously receive a {@code MessageConsumer}'s 
 * messages or have the {@code MessageConsumer} asynchronously deliver them 
 * as they arrive. 
 * <p>
 * For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a 
 * {@code MessageConsumer} using one of its {@code receive} methods. There are several 
 * variations of {@code receive} that allow a client to poll or wait for the next message. 
 * <p>
 * For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a {@code MessageListener} object 
 * with a {@code MessageConsumer}.
 * As messages arrive at the {@code MessageConsumer}, it delivers them by calling 
 * the {@code MessageListener}'s {@code onMessage} method.
 * <p>
 * It is a client programming error for a {@code MessageListener} to throw an exception.
