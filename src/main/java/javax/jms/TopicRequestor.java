  * {@code TemporaryTopic} for the responses and provides a 
  * {@code request} method that sends the request message and waits 
  * for its reply.
  * <p>
  * This is a very basic request/reply abstraction which assumes the session 
  * is non-transacted with a delivery mode of either AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or 
  * DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. It is expected that most applications will create 
  * less basic implementations.
