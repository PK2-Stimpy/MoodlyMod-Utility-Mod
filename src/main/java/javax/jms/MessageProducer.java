	 * sending the message in a separate thread and notifying the specified
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> when the operation has completed. JMS refers
	 * to this as an "asynchronous send".
	 * <p>
	 * When the message has been successfully sent the JMS provider invokes the
	 * callback method <tt>onCompletion</tt> on an application-specified
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object. Only when that callback has been
	 * invoked can the application be sure that the message has been
	 * successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal
	 * synchronous send had been performed. An application which requires this
	 * degree of confidence must therefore wait for the callback to be invoked
	 * before continuing.
	 * <p>
	 * The following information is intended to give an indication of how an
	 * asynchronous send would typically be implemented.
	 * <p>
	 * In some JMS providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the
	 * message to a remote JMS server and then waiting for an acknowledgement to
	 * be received before returning. It is expected that such a provider would
	 * implement an asynchronous send by sending the message to the remote JMS
	 * server and then returning without waiting for an acknowledgement. When
	 * the acknowledgement is received, the JMS provider would notify the
	 * application by invoking the <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the
	 * application-specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object. If for some
	 * reason the acknowledgement is not received the JMS provider would notify
	 * the application by invoking the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s
	 * <tt>onException</tt> method.
	 * <p>
	 * In those cases where the JMS specification permits a lower level of
	 * reliability, a normal synchronous send might not wait for an
	 * acknowledgement. In that case it is expected that an asynchronous send
	 * would be similar to a synchronous send: the JMS provider would send the
	 * message to the remote JMS server and then return without waiting for an
	 * acknowledgement. However the JMS provider would still notify the
	 * application that the send had completed by invoking the
	 * <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
	 * <p>
	 * It is up to the JMS provider to decide exactly what is performed in the
	 * calling thread and what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so
	 * long as it satisfies the requirements given below:
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Quality of service</b>: After the send operation has completed
	 * successfully, which means that the message has been successfully sent
	 * with the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had
	 * been performed, the JMS provider must invoke the
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> method. The
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> must not be invoked earlier than this.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Exceptions</b>: If an exception is encountered during the call to the
	 * <tt>send</tt> method then an appropriate exception should be thrown in
	 * the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt> method. In this case the JMS provider
	 * must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt>
	 * or <tt>onException</tt> method. If an exception is encountered which
	 * cannot be thrown in the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt> method then the
	 * JMS provider must call the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s
	 * <tt>onException</tt> method. In both cases if an exception occurs it is
	 * undefined whether or not the message was successfully sent.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Message order</b>: If the same <tt>MessageProducer</tt> is used to
	 * send multiple messages then JMS message ordering requirements must be
	 * satisfied. This applies even if a combination of synchronous and
	 * asynchronous sends has been performed. The application is not required to
	 * wait for an asynchronous send to complete before sending the next
	 * message.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Close, commit or rollback</b>: If the <tt>close</tt> method is called
	 * on the <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or its <tt>Session</tt> or
	 * <tt>Connection</tt> then the JMS provider must block until any incomplete
	 * send operations have been completed and all
	 * {@code CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before closing
	 * the object and returning. If the session is transacted (uses a local
	 * transaction) then when the <tt>Session</tt>'s <tt>commit</tt> or
	 * <tt>rollback</tt> method is called the JMS provider must block until any
	 * incomplete send operations have been completed and all
	 * {@code CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before performing
	 * the commit or rollback. Incomplete sends should be allowed to complete
	 * normally unless an error occurs.
	 * <p>
	 * A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call
	 * <tt>close</tt> on its own <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or
	 * <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> on
	 * its own <tt>Session</tt>. Doing so will cause the <tt>close</tt>,
	 * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> to throw an
	 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a
	 * Java EE EJB or web container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} 
	 * to be thrown though this is not guaranteed.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and
	 * message properties which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If
	 * the send is asynchronous these fields and properties may be accessed on
	 * the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been
	 * invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method
	 * is called then the state of these message header fields and properties is
	 * undefined.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an
	 * asynchronous send must confirm to the threading restrictions defined in
	 * JMS. This means that the session may be used by only one thread at a
	 * time.
	 * <p>
	 * Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be
	 * dedicated to the thread of control which calls the
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may therefore
	 * continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send.

	 * The following information is intended to give an indication of how an

	 * <p>
	 * In some JMS providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the

	 * <tt>onException</tt> method.
	 * <p>
	 * In those cases where the JMS specification permits a lower level of

	 * acknowledgement. However the JMS provider would still notify the
	 * application that the send had completed by invoking the
	 * <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
	 * <p>
	 * It is up to the JMS provider to decide exactly what is performed in the
	 * calling thread and what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so
	 * long as it satisfies the requirements given below:
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Quality of service</b>: After the send operation has completed
	 * successfully, which means that the message has been successfully sent
	 * with the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had
	 * been performed, the JMS provider must invoke the
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> method. The
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> must not be invoked earlier than this.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Exceptions</b>: If an exception is encountered during the call to the
	 * <tt>send</tt> method then an appropriate exception should be thrown in
	 * the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt> method. In this case the JMS provider
	 * must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt>
	 * or <tt>onException</tt> method. If an exception is encountered which
	 * cannot be thrown in the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt> method then the
	 * JMS provider must call the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s
	 * <tt>onException</tt> method. In both cases if an exception occurs it is
	 * undefined whether or not the message was successfully sent.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Message order</b>: If the same <tt>MessageProducer</tt> is used to
	 * send multiple messages then JMS message ordering requirements must be
	 * satisfied. This applies even if a combination of synchronous and
	 * asynchronous sends has been performed. The application is not required to
	 * wait for an asynchronous send to complete before sending the next
	 * message.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Close, commit or rollback</b>: If the <tt>close</tt> method is called
	 * on the <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or its <tt>Session</tt> or
	 * <tt>Connection</tt> then the JMS provider must block until any incomplete
	 * send operations have been completed and all
	 * {@code CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before closing
	 * the object and returning. If the session is transacted (uses a local
	 * transaction) then when the <tt>Session</tt>'s <tt>commit</tt> or
	 * <tt>rollback</tt> method is called the JMS provider must block until any
	 * incomplete send operations have been completed and all
	 * {@code CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before performing
	 * the commit or rollback. Incomplete sends should be allowed to complete
	 * normally unless an error occurs.
	 * <p>
	 * A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call
	 * <tt>close</tt> on its own <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or
	 * <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> on

	 * <p> 
	 * <b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a
	 * Java EE EJB or web container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} 
	 * to be thrown though this is not guaranteed.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and
	 * message properties which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If
	 * the send is asynchronous these fields and properties may be accessed on
	 * the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been
	 * invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method
	 * is called then the state of these message header fields and properties is
	 * undefined.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an
	 * asynchronous send must confirm to the threading restrictions defined in
	 * JMS. This means that the session may be used by only one thread at a
	 * time.
	 * <p>
	 * Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be
	 * dedicated to the thread of control which calls the
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may therefore
	 * continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send.

	 * normally unless an error occurs.
	 * <p>
	 * A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call
	 * <tt>close</tt> on its own <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or
	 * <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> on
	 * its own <tt>Session</tt>. Doing so will cause the <tt>close</tt>,
	 * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> to throw an
	 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a
	 * Java EE EJB or web container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} 
	 * to be thrown though this is not guaranteed.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and
	 * message properties which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If
	 * the send is asynchronous these fields and properties may be accessed on
	 * the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been
	 * invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method
	 * is called then the state of these message header fields and properties is
	 * undefined.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an
	 * asynchronous send must confirm to the threading restrictions defined in
	 * JMS. This means that the session may be used by only one thread at a
	 * time.
	 * <p>
	 * Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be
	 * dedicated to the thread of control which calls the
	 * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may therefore
	 * continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send.
	 * However the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s callback methods must not use
	 * the session if an application thread might be using the session at the
	 * same time.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Use of the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> by the JMS provider</b>: A
	 * session will only invoke one <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method
	 * at a time. For a given <tt>MessageProducer</tt>, callbacks (both
	 * {@code onCompletion} and {@code onException}) will be performed
	 * in the same order as the corresponding calls to the asynchronous send
	 * method.
	 * A JMS provider must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> from the
	 * thread that is calling the asynchronous <tt>send</tt> method.
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Restrictions on the use of the Message object</b>: Applications which
	 * perform an asynchronous send must take account of the restriction that a
	 * <tt>Message</tt> object is designed to be accessed by one logical thread
	 * of control at a time and does not support concurrent use.
	 * <p>
	 * After the <tt>send</tt> method has returned, the application must not
	 * attempt to read the headers, properties or body of the
	 * <tt>Message</tt> object until the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s
	 * <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method has been called.
	 * This is because the JMS provider may be modifying the <tt>Message</tt>
	 * object in another thread during this time. The JMS provider may throw an
	 * <tt>JMSException</tt> if the application attempts to access or modify the
	 * <tt>Message</tt> object after the <tt>send</tt> method has returned and
	 * before the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been invoked. If the JMS
	 * provider does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.
