/** A client uses a {@code TopicPublisher} object to publish messages on a 
  * topic. A {@code TopicPublisher} object is the publish-subscribe form
  * of a message producer.
  *
  * <P>Normally, the {@code Topic} is specified when a 
  * {@code TopicPublisher} is created.  In this case, an attempt to use 
  * the {@code publish} methods for an unidentified 
  * {@code TopicPublisher} will throw a 
  * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
  *
  * <P>If the {@code TopicPublisher} is created with an unidentified 
  * {@code Topic}, an attempt to use the {@code publish} methods that 
  * assume that the {@code Topic} has been identified will throw a 
  * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
  *
  * <P>During the execution of its {@code publish} method,
  * a message must not be changed by other threads within the client. 
  * If the message is modified, the result of the {@code publish} is 
  * undefined.
  * 
  * <P>After publishing a message, a client may retain and modify it
  * without affecting the message that has been published. The same message
  * object may be published multiple times.
  * 
  * <P>The following message headers are set as part of publishing a 
  * message: {@code JMSDestination}, {@code JMSDeliveryMode}, 
  * {@code JMSExpiration}, {@code JMSPriority}, 
  * {@code JMSMessageID} and {@code JMSTimeStamp}.
  * When the message is published, the values of these headers are ignored. 
  * After completion of the {@code publish}, the headers hold the values 
  * specified by the method publishing the message. It is possible for the 
  * {@code publish} method not to set {@code JMSMessageID} and 
  * {@code JMSTimeStamp} if the 
  * setting of these headers is explicitly disabled by the 
  * {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageID} or
  * {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageTimestamp} method.
  *
  *<P>Creating a {@code MessageProducer} provides the same features as
  * creating a {@code TopicPublisher}. A {@code MessageProducer} object is 
  * recommended when creating new code. The  {@code TopicPublisher} is
  * provided to support existing code.

  *
  *<P>Because {@code TopicPublisher} inherits from 
  * {@code MessageProducer}, it inherits the
  * {@code send} methods that are a part of the {@code MessageProducer} 
  * interface. Using the {@code send} methods will have the same
  * effect as using the
  * {@code publish} methods: they are functionally the same.
